                <h3>Espresso</h3>
                <p>Espresso is a delicious concentrated form of coffee, served in shots. It’s often the coffee base of many other beverages, 
                    such as cappuccino, latte, americano and macchiato. An espresso is intense and bold, but nonetheless delicious, and usually served in small demitasse-style cups for this reason.</p>

                <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
                <p>A cappuccino is a beloved espresso-based hot coffee drink made with layering of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam on top. The taste of cappuccinos can be described as creamy, smooth, and balanced. The combination of flavors and textures creates a delightful and comforting experience for many coffee enthusiasts.</p>
